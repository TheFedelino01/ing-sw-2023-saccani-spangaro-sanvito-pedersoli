 -> Chat  
 -> Client side disconnection  
 -> Multiple games  
 -> Complete rules  
   
Code Coverage (autogenerated badges from [here](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator)) 
  
![Coverage](.github/badges/jacoco.svg)  
![Branches](.github/badges/branches.svg)  
  
  
Code Coverage was also autogenerated, using [JaCoCo](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/)  
    
How to run the game:  
1. Intellij: maven men첫 -> MyShelfie -> Lifecycle -> Clean  
2. Intellij: maven men첫 -> MyShelfie -> Lifecycle -> Package  
3. Open CMD, on project directory:   
   -> C:/[dir]/ing-sw-2023-saccani-spangaro-sanvito-pedersoli/MyShelfie/target  
   From here:  
   -> java -jar softeng-gc04-1.0-SNAPSHOT-client.jar (for the clients)  
   -> java -jar softeng-gc04-1.0-SNAPSHOT-server.jar (for the server)  
   
Repeat from (1) each time the code is modified  

To generate the Code Coverage:  
1. Intellij: maven men첫 -> MyShelfie -> Lifecycle -> Clean  
2. Intellij: maven men첫 -> MyShelfie -> Lifecycle -> Test  
Code Coverage will be generated in:  
 -> C:/[dir]/ing-sw-2023-saccani-spangaro-sanvito-pedersoli/MyShelfie/target/site/jacoco/index.html
